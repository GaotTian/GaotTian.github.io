I am currently a PhD student in Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, School of Geospatial, University of Information Engineering.

I received my bachelor's degree in surveying and mapping engineering from the University of Information Engineering in 2022.

My current research focuses on image registration and polar sea ice drift prediction using multi-sensor remote sensing images.
